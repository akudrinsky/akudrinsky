**07.20 - 08.20 Creator - website**

Not very great, but working site. (Golang, PostgreSQL)

**05.20 - 06.20 Creator - dictator language.**

A C-like language, which is Turing-complete and can be compiled to Mach-O executable file (so, I implemented tokenizer, parser and compiler for my language). (C/C++)

**11.19 - 12.19 Creator - differentiator.**

I was tired of finding derivatives of different functions, so created my small version of Wolfram Alpha, that can find derivatives and explains how it did that in a short latex report. (C/C++, LaTeX)
